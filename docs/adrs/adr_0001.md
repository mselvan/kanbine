# ADR-0001: Use Service Classes Instead of ServiceImpl

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In the backend development, a common pattern is to use interfaces for services and have corresponding implementation classes that are suffixed with "Impl". For example, `UserService` would have an implementation class named `UserServiceImpl`. This pattern is often used to provide flexibility for future changes, such as multiple implementations of a service interface.

However, our project currently does not require multiple implementations of the service interfaces. Using the "Impl" suffix pattern can lead to unnecessary complexity and confusion, particularly when there is only one implementation. This approach also introduces additional boilerplate code, which can reduce the maintainability and clarity of the codebase.

## Decision
We will forgo the use of service interfaces and their corresponding "Impl" implementation classes in favor of directly using service classes without the "Impl" suffix. Each service class will directly handle the logic related to its respective domain without the need for an interface unless a clear requirement for multiple implementations arises in the future. 

This maybe important in a box product where the implementation is left for the customers to choose. But in a SaaS product, it's easier and efficient to maintain a single implementation. 

For example:
- Instead of having `UserService` and `UserServiceImpl`, we will have a single `UserService` class that handles all user-related business logic.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Simplicity**: The codebase will be simpler and more straightforward, reducing the amount of boilerplate code and making the project easier to understand for new developers.
- **Maintainability**: With fewer files and classes to manage, the project will be easier to maintain.
- **Clarity**: Developers can focus on a single class for each service, reducing confusion and potential errors.

### Negative Consequences
- **Flexibility**: If the need arises for multiple implementations of a service in the future, it may require refactoring to introduce interfaces.
- **Consistency**: This approach diverges from the traditional pattern used in many enterprise applications, which may require additional explanation to developers familiar with the "Impl" pattern.
