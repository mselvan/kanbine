# ADR-0002: Use Base DTO Classes for Request and Response DTOs

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In the Kanbine project, data transfer objects (DTOs) are used to encapsulate data exchanged between the client and the server. A common approach is to define separate DTO classes for requests and responses, which may result in duplicated code when both share common fields.

To reduce redundancy and improve maintainability, we can create base DTO classes that contain common fields. Request and response DTOs can then extend these base classes, inheriting the common properties while allowing for additional fields and specific logic in the derived classes.

For example:
- We can create a `UserDTO` base class containing common fields like `id` and `email`.
- `UserRequest` and `UserResponse` classes would extend `UserDTO`, adding specific fields such as `password` for `UserRequest`.

## Decision
We will adopt the approach of using base DTO classes that encapsulate common fields. Request DTOs and response DTOs will extend these base classes, inheriting the shared properties. This approach will be applied consistently across the project for all DTOs.

### Example Structure:

```java
// Base DTO class
public class UserDTO {
protected Long id;
protected String email;
}

// Request DTO extending base class
public class UserRequest extends UserDTO {
private String password;
}

// Response DTO extending base class
public class UserResponse extends UserDTO {
// Additional response-specific fields can be added here
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Common fields are defined only once, reducing code duplication across request and response DTOs.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to common fields need to be made in only one place, making the code easier to maintain and less prone to errors.
- **Consistency**: This approach enforces a consistent structure for DTOs, making the codebase easier to understand and navigate.

### Negative Consequences
- **Complexity**: Introducing inheritance in DTOs may add some complexity, especially if the inheritance chain becomes deep or if there are many variations of DTOs.
- **Overhead**: Care must be taken to ensure that the base DTOs do not become overly complex or overloaded with too many fields, which could lead to bloated objects and reduced performance.
